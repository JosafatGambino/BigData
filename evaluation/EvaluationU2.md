## EVALUATIVE PRACTICE UNIT 2 - BIG DATA

In the next set of instructions, each instruction contains the code fulfilling 
the corresponding purpose.

### 1. Load in a dataframe _Iris.csv_ from https://github.com/jcromerohdz/iris, make data cleaning needed to be processed by the following algorithm (Important, this cleaning must be done by means of a Scala script in Spark).

**a. Use the Mllib library of Spark the corresponding Machine Learning algorithm
to multilayer perceived**

### 2. What are the names of the columns?

### 3. How is the scheme?

### 4. Print the first 5 columns.

### 5. Use the described method () to learn more about DataFrame data.

### 6. Make the relevant transformation for the categorical data which will beour labels to classify.

### 7. Construct the classification models and explain their architecture.

### 8. Print the results of the model
