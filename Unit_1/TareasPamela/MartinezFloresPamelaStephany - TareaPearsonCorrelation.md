### PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT 

Pearson's correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that allows you to calculate the relationship 
between two variables, as long as they are quantitative and continuous variables. Pearson is the most 
commonly used correlation coefficient for calculating linear type relationships.

##### How to interpret Pearson's linear correlation coefficient?

The result of calculating the Pearson Correlation Index (we will call r) will always be in the range [-1, 1]. 
Indicating 1 a total positive correlation, and -1 a total negative correlation.

Therefore:

* If **r = |1|**, it will be a perfect correlation.
* If **r = 1**, we'll be talking about a perfect POSITIVE correlation.
* If **r = -1**, we'll be talking about a perfect NEGATIVE correlation.
* If **r = 0**, we will say that there is no correlation between the variables.
* If **r is negative** (that is, the value of r is between -1 and 0), we will be talking about a negative correlation between the variables. 

The closer to zero the value of r, the smaller the relationship between variables, or in other words, the closer it is to r of -1, the more related the variables will be.

* If r is positive (that is, the value is between 0 and 1), we will talk about the existence of a positive correlation between the variables. 

The closer to zero the value of r, the less relationship there will be between the two variables, the closer the value of r to 1, the more related the variables will be.
