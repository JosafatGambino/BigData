### What is it?

It is a linear measure between two quantitative random variables, which allows us to know the intensity and direction of the relationship between them, it is an index that measures the degree of covariation between different linearly related variables.

### What is it for?

Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to study the relationship (or correlation) between two quantitative random variables (minimum interval scale); for example, the relationship between weight and height.
It is a measure that gives us information about the intensity and direction of the relationship. In other words, it is an index that measures the degree of covariation between different linearly related variables.
We must be clear about the difference between relationship, correlation or covariation between two variables (= joint variation) and causality (also called forecast, prediction or regression), since they are different concepts.

### How is it interpreted?

Pearson's correlation coefficient *comprises values ​​between -1 and +1*. Thus, depending on its value, it will have one meaning or another.
If the Pearson correlation coefficient is equal to 1 or -1, we can consider that the correlation that exists between the variables studied is perfect.
If the coefficient is greater than 0, the correlation is positive ("A more, more, and less less"). On the other hand, if it is less than 0 (negative), the correlation is negative ("A more, less, and a less, more"). Finally, if the coefficient is equal to 0, we can only say that there is no linear relationship between the variables, but there may be some other type of relationship.

### How is it calculated?

It is calculated with the following expression:

Where:

"X" is equal to variable number one, "y" belongs to variable number two, "zx" is the standard deviation of variable one, "zy" is the standard deviation of variable two, and "N" is is number of data.

### Results analysis:
The value of the correlation index varies in the interval [-1,1], the sign indicating the direction of the relationship:

* If *r = 1*, there is a perfect positive correlation. The index indicates a total dependence between the two variables called a direct relationship: when one of them increases, the other also increases in constant proportion.
* If *0 < r < 1*, ​​there is a positive correlation.
* If *r = 0*, there is no linear relationship. But this does not necessarily imply that the variables are independent: there may still be nonlinear relationships between the two variables.
* If *-1 < r < 0*, there is a negative correlation.
* If *r = -1*, there is a perfect negative correlation. The index indicates a total dependence between the two variables called an inverse relationship: when one of them increases, the other decreases in constant proportion.
