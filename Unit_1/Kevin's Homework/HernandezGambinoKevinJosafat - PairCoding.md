### What is “Pair Coding”?

Pair Programming requires two programmers to participate in a combined development effort at one workplace.
Each member performs an action that the other is not currently doing: While one codes the unit tests the other thinks about the class that will satisfy the test, for example.
The person who is doing the coding is given the controller name while the person who is directing is called the browser. It is often suggested that the two partners switch roles at least every half hour or after a unit test is done.

### Why do we need “Pair Coding”?

Pair coding is used mainly for efficiency reasons, using it is practically two brains focused on the same problem, in this way fewer errors would be made when coding, since it would be much easier to find errors that the other person may not know. account, or find a more optimal way to solve the problem.

### Advantages of "Pair Coding"

Pair programming focuses on the following advantages, ordered from highest to lowest.
* *More Discipline.* By pairing correctly they are more likely to do "the right thing" rather than taking long breaks.
* *Better code.* By matching similar they are less likely to produce bad designs since their intention tends to design with higher quality.
* *Constant work flow.* Pairing produces a different workflow when working alone. In a Relationship the workflow recovers more quickly: one programmer asks the other "where do we meet?" Pairs are more resistant to interruptions as one developer deals with the interruption while the other continues to work.
* *Multiple new developments to the design.* If the pairs rotate frequently in the project it means that more people are involved with a particular characteristic. This helps create better solutions, especially when a couple cannot solve a difficult problem.
* *Improved morale.* Pair programming is more enjoyable for some programmers than programming alone.
* *Collective ownership of the code.* When the project is done in pairs, and the pairs are rotated frequently, everyone has a knowledge of the codebase.
* *Teaching.* Everyone, even newbies, possess knowledge that others do not. Pair programming is a fun way to share knowledge.
* *Team cohesion.* People get to know each other faster when programming as a couple. Pair programming can enliven the team feeling.
* *Few interruptions.* People are more reluctant to interrupt a partner than a person who works alone.
* *Fewer workstations.* Since two people will work at one workstation, fewer workstations are required, and the extra workstations can be occupied for other purposes.

### Disadvantages of "Pair Coding"

* Expert developers may find it tedious to teach a less experienced developer in a paired environment.
* Many developers prefer to work alone and find the paired environment uncomfortable.
* Productivity is difficult to measure, to compare developers in pairs versus developers working alone, they use programming metrics that are controversial at best.
* Differences in coding style can result in conflicts, although this in turn promotes normalization (standardization), so that everyone can understand the code.
* In case the couple has slightly different work schedules, which is common in an environment that values ​​work-life balance, the couple will only function at the intersection of the schedules. Therefore, more person hours are required to complete a task, a typical day has fewer partner hours, which increases the time to complete the task.
* A company that works with Telecommuting (working from home or remotely) or when an employee must work from outside the offices for any reason, programming in pairs becomes difficult or even impossible.
